## External API

Using the External (Joke) API, this is what we expect a joke object to look like and the properties it contains:

```sh
{
  "id": last joke id + 1,
  "type": "programming",
  "setup": "What's the best thing about a Boolean",
  "punchline": "Even if you're wrong, you're only off by a bit."
}
```
